# Connect to EC2 instance with SSH.

# Update instance.
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install the mariadb-client.
sudo apt-get install mariadb-client -y

# Connect the clarusdb on MariaDB Server on the other EC2 instance (pw:clarus1234).
mysql -h ec2-3-94-163-77.compute-1.amazonaws.com -u clarususer -p

# Show that clarususer can do same db operations on MariaDB Server instance.
SHOW DATABASES;
USE clarusdb;
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM employees;
SELECT * FROM offices;
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, city, state FROM employees INNER JOIN offices ON employees.office_id=offices.office_id WHERE employees.salary > 100000;
