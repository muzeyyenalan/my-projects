##  Part 4 - Creating role and attaching to EC2

- Create a role :

```text
Trusted Entity : AWS services
Use case       : EC2
Permission     : S3FullAccess
Name           : MyFirstRole
```
- Launch an Instance ******without role :

```text
-AMI             : Amazon Linux 2
-Instance Type   : t2.micro
-Step 3: Configure Instance Details:

  - ****IAM role     : "None"

  - User data       :

#!/bin/bash

yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
cd /var/www/html
aws s3 cp s3://osvaldo-pipeline-production/index.html .
aws s3 cp s3://osvaldo-pipeline-production/cat.jpg .
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl start httpd 

- Security Group: HTTP & SSH Allowed

```
- Launch an Instance with  ****MyFirstRole:
```text
-AMI             : Amazon Linux 2
-Instance Type   : t2.micro
-Step 3: Configure Instance Details:

  - ****IAM role     : MyFirstRole

  - User data       :

#!/bin/bash

yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
cd /var/www/html
aws s3 cp s3://osvaldo-pipeline-production/index.html .
aws s3 cp s3://osvaldo-pipeline-production/cat.jpg .
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl start httpd 

- Security Group: HTTP & SSH Allowed

```
- Show that the instance without role wasn't able to access S3 bucket. So the web page couldn't fetch the index.html and cat.jpg file.
